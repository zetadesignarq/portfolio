          <p class="lede">This is Emily Zavala…</p>

          <div class="about__body">
            <p>An Ecuadorian architect with an international background that has shaped the way I design through curiosity, exploration, and continuous learning.</p>

            <p>I studied Architecture at Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico, a place that became my home for four years and where I had the opportunity to engage with different cultures, perspectives, and ways of understanding design. During that time, I discovered the richness of materials, proportion, and style, as well as the influence of renowned Latin American architecture masters.</p>

            <p>Near the end of my degree, I traveled to Italy to earn a certification in Interior Design in Contemporary Living, completing a semester at the Istituto Lorenzo de’ Medici. That experience allowed me to dive deeper into contemporary interior design from a more artistic and detail-driven perspective, and it confirmed something that truly defines me: I love stepping outside my comfort zone to keep learning.</p>

            <p>After completing one of the most important personal milestones of my life, earning my architecture degree, I knew it was essential to continue growing. I am currently pursuing my Master of Architecture at SCAD, where I’m expanding my vision, meeting new creative minds, and embracing the practices, concepts, and architectural systems unique to the United States. This stage excites me because it allows me to connect the best of Latin American construction knowledge with North American methods and standards.</p>

            <p>I’m passionate about what is new, technological, artistic, and functional. I enjoy creating spaces that are not only visually compelling, even unconventional, but also purposeful and tailored to real life: daily routines, needs, and aspirations. For me, the essence of design happens when form and function come together with clarity and intention.</p>

            <p>I’m ready to create eclectic spaces with character, bringing together the best of style, form, function, and identity to tell a story that feels uniquely yours.</p>

    "description": "Vinum is located in Florence, Italy.\n\nIt consists of an interior design project born from a client's desire to remodel an old space in a developing tourist sector.\n\nResearching the main products sold in the region and its most important traditions was essential for creating the concept: a space where, in addition to providing a consumer experience, the process is conveyed through visual elements and interior materials.\n\nAs part of the design strategies for the space, tactical urbanism concepts were used to create a self-guiding experience for users through materiality.\n\nDifferent types of ceramic tiles were selected for the floors to facilitate self-guided circulation, ensuring users do not get lost during their experience in each room.\n\nAdditionally, this approach aims to evoke a sense of 'curiosity' to encourage return visits and promote the discovery of the place.\n\nIn this way, it fosters learning about local traditions and helps preserve them, while providing an experience similar to those offered in vineyards not too far from the area."

    "description": "The showroom design is based on recreating the same experience that Archadeck’s clients have during the remodeling of their outdoor spaces.\n\nThe material selection emulates those typically used in outdoor living projects and includes areas that recreate an exterior deck inside the showroom, allowing users to directly feel the client experience.\n\nThe spatial organization of the showroom is conceived as a gradual transition from public to private.\n\nFirst, there is the public zone, where hardware, material options, and other design elements are displayed.\n\nNext, a semi-private area integrates the service zone, coffee station, and meeting room for clients who have already signed a contract.\n\nFinally, the private coworking area for Archadeck is located at the back, where the internal team and designers work."
